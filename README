I currently only can get this working, if I flash it to the CH569
with gdb and openocd  over wch-link as follows:

1. Start openocd:
You have to set the chip into debug mode with the WCHISPTool.exe or https://github.com/hansfbaier/ch569tool
$ cd "MounRiverInstallDirectory"/MounRiver_Studio*/MRS*/toolchain/OpenOCD/bin
$ ./openocd -f wch-riscv.cfg 

2. In another shell go to mecrisp-quintus-0.37-experimental/mecrisp-quintus-source/ch569x

3. set ARMGNU to your installed riscv compiler:
$ export ARMGNU=riscv64-unknown-elf

4. build:
$ make

5. flash it:
gdb-multiarch mecrisp-quintus-ch56x.elf
target extended-remote localhost:3333
load
run

done

this will flash the ELF file contents into the device flash.

You probably have to close gdb and openocd and re-power the board to
get it running for the first time.
The UART speed of the terminal on UART1 is set to 500000 baud by default.
